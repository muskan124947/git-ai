2. Enable JDBC tracing as per the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/jdbc/tracing-driver-operation) to capture detailed logs during the insert operation. Analyze the logs to understand how the trigger interaction affects the retrieval of generated keys.
3. Test the insertion operation without the trigger on TABLE_A to confirm that the issue is specifically related to the trigger's interaction with the generated keys retrieval process.
4. Contact the vendor's support or file a bug report with detailed information including JDBC version, SQL Server version, error logs, and a clear description of how the trigger is affecting the generated keys. Include the JDBC trace logs that were captured.
5. As a temporary workaround, consider modifying the application logic to capture the IDENTITY value directly from TABLE_A after the insert operation, using a separate query like `SELECT @@IDENTITY AS 'Identity';`. This is not ideal but can serve until a permanent solution is provided by the vendor or through driver updates.

1. Ensure compatibility between the JDBC driver version and SQL Server version. Consider downgrading the JDBC driver to version 13.1.1.jre11-preview as mentioned, to verify if this resolves the issue with the trigger and key generation.

2. Implement error handling around the `preparedStatement.getGeneratedKeys()` call to catch and log any SQLServerExceptions. This might provide more detailed insights into why the keys aren't being fetched when the trigger is present.

3. Investigate the trigger's behavior on `TABLE_A` by temporarily disabling it and running the insert operation again. If the keys are returned successfully without the trigger, consider modifying the trigger logic to ensure it does not interfere with the retrieval of generated keys.

4. Test the insert operation and trigger on a simplified setup (e.g., a local database environment) to verify if the issue persists across different environments or is specific to the current setup.

5. Contact Microsoft SQL Server support or consult the Microsoft documentation for any known issues or patches related to triggers and key generation with your specific configuration of SQL Server 2019 and JDBC driver.

1. Verify that the issue is specific to the JDBC driver version `13.2.0.jre11` by testing with the previous driver version `13.1.1.jre11-preview` where the functionality worked as expected. This will confirm if the problem is related to a regression in the newer driver version.

2. If the issue is confirmed to be a regression, open a ticket with Microsoft, providing all relevant details including JDBC driver versions, SQL Server version, table schema, and a detailed description of how triggers affect the retrieval of generated keys. Include any error messages and stack traces for their analysis.

3. As a workaround, consider disabling the trigger on `TABLE_A` temporarily to see if the keys are returned as expected. This isn�t a permanent solution but can be useful for immediate needs while waiting for a bug fix.

4. Explore alternative ways to retrieve the generated keys, such as executing a separate query to fetch the last inserted ID from `TABLE_A` after the insertion operation, in case the direct method via `getGeneratedKeys()` remains non-functional.

5. Keep the repository�s documentation and users informed about the issue and any potential workarounds or fixes by updating the README file and creating a known issues section if not already present. This will help users to understand the current limitations and avoid similar issues.

1. Verify the JDBC driver version currently used in the project. Check if it's compatible with the database being used and if there are any known issues with `getFunctions()` and `getProcedures()` in this version.
2. Update the JDBC driver to the latest stable version if it's outdated and retest the methods to see if the issue persists.
3. Review the source code where `DatabaseMetaData.getFunctions()` and `DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures()` are called. Ensure that the correct filtering parameters (if any) are being passed to these methods.
4. Implement a workaround in the application code to manually filter the results returned from these methods, distinguishing between functions and procedures based on their characteristics or metadata.
5. Report this issue to the JDBC driver�s support or community forum, providing details of the erroneous behavior, along with your environment specifics and any test cases that demonstrate the issue. Monitor for any patches or recommendations they might provide.

1. Verify the JDBC driver version being used in the project. Update the JDBC driver to the latest version available, as this might be a bug that has been fixed in newer versions of the driver.

2. Implement a workaround in the codebase where both `DatabaseMetaData.getFunctions()` and `DatabaseMetaData.getProcedures()` are called, but manually filter the results in the application logic. Use metadata properties such as `FUNCTION_TYPE` or `PROCEDURE_TYPE` to distinguish between functions and procedures.

3. Report this issue to the JDBC driver's maintainers if it persists after updating the driver. Provide them with details including the driver version, database version, and a script to reproduce the issue.

4. As a temporary measure, consider using an alternative method to fetch metadata, such as querying the database's system tables directly (e.g., `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES` in SQL Server) to retrieve accurate information about functions and procedures.

5. Monitor the issue reported to the JDBC driver�s maintainers and plan to integrate any patches or updates they release that address the problem. Make sure to test these updates in a development environment before deploying to production.

1. Review the implementation of `getFunctions()` and `getProcedures()` in the driver source code to understand how both functions and procedures are currently being retrieved.
2. Modify the `getFunctions()` method to ensure that it filters out all procedures and only returns functions. This might involve adjusting the SQL query or the method's logic that interprets the results from the database.
3. Adjust the `getProcedures()` method to exclude functions and ensure it only fetches and returns procedures. Again, check if the SQL query needs amendment or if the result processing logic should be refined.
4. Write unit tests to validate that `getFunctions()` only returns functions and `getProcedures()` only returns procedures as per the JDBC specification. Include tests that check for edge cases and mixed scenarios.
5. Update the documentation to reflect the changes made to these methods and inform users about the adherence to the JDBC specifications with these updates.

1. Verify the JDBC driver version being used in the project. Check if there is a newer version available that might have addressed this bug.
2. Review the source code of the JDBC driver, specifically looking at the implementations of `getFunctions()` and `getProcedures()` in the `DatabaseMetaData` class to identify where the overlap occurs.
3. Develop a patch or workaround in the JDBC driver source code that correctly filters functions and procedures in the respective methods. Test the modifications extensively to ensure they behave as expected.
4. If modifying the JDBC driver is not feasible, consider implementing a temporary fix in the project code that manually filters the results from `getFunctions()` and `getProcedures()` based on the type of database object.
5. Submit a bug report or pull request to the original JDBC driver repository with the findings and any fixes if changes were made locally. Include test cases and a clear description of the issue and resolution steps.

1. Review the current OSGi MANIFEST.MF file to identify any direct or transitive dependencies on IBM or com.sun packages that could cause the deployment issue.
2. Modify the MANIFEST.MF file to exclude the IBM and com.sun packages by setting the appropriate 'Import-Package' using a negation pattern or by configuring 'DynamicImport-Package' if feasible, to reduce the strictness of the imports.
3. Add compatibility layers or use alternative packages that are compliant with OSGi standards and do not require IBM or com.sun dependencies to ensure functionality does not break after removing these dependencies.
4. Test the modified application in an OSGi environment to ensure that it deploys successfully without the unwanted IBM and com.sun dependencies.
5. Document the changes in the repository to guide future deployments and inform users of the updates regarding dependency management and OSGi compatibility.

1. Identify and remove any IBM-specific and com.sun-specific dependencies from the module's `MANIFEST.MF` file or equivalent OSGi configuration files.
2. Replace the removed dependencies with OSGi-compliant alternatives or implement functionality to achieve the same outcome without relying on IBM or com.sun libraries.
3. Update the build configuration (e.g., Maven `pom.xml` or Gradle `build.gradle`) to ensure that the module is packaged with the required OSGi metadata and dependencies for an OSGi-compliant environment.
4. Test the module in a controlled OSGi environment to verify successful deployment and functionality without IBM and com.sun dependencies.
5. Document the changes and update the README or relevant project documentation to reflect the new OSGi-compliant setup and deployment instructions.
